        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a ganache filling that bumps up the rich chocolate flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.</p>
        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>sanding sugar</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
            <li>    
        <p>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</p>
            <li>
        <p>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. 
            With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.</p>
            <li>
        <p>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. 
            Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide).</p>
            <li>
        <p>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, 
            rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
            <li>
        <p>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of each ball with your thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in the oven.</p>
            <li>
        <p>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. 
            Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. 
            Place about 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. 
            The cookies will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>
