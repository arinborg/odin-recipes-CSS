        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my family's favorite Christmas dinner. Elegant for dinner parties or a romantic dinner for two. 
            If you desire crabmeat instead of lobster, go for it!</p>
        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (8 ounce) filet mignon (beef tenderloin)</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>4 slices bacon</li>
                <li>½ cup butter, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon OLD BAY® Seasoning</li>
                <li>8 ounces lobster tail, cleaned and chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
        <p>Set oven to Broil at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
            <li>    
        <p>Sprinkle tenderloins all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap each filet with bacon, and secure with a toothpick. 
            Place on a broiling pan, and broil to desired doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium rare.</p>
            <li>
        <p>While tenderloins are cooking, melt 1/4 cup of butter over medium heat with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay® seasoning. Stir in chopped lobster meat, and cook until done. 
            Spoon lobster meat over cooked tenderloins, and return them to the broiler until the lobster meat begins to brown.</p>
            <li>
        <p>While the lobster is in the oven, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, cook until it browns, turning the color of a hazelnut. 
            To serve, spoon the browned butter over the steaks, and sprinkle with the remaining Old Bay® seasoning.</p>
